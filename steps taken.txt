Collapsed a lot of the very empty columns (so they are not visible, but they are still present in the document); might want to somehow make this change permanent

Column 001:
Control Number ** NOT ISBN, that would be in 020
renamed column to reflect contents

Column 008:
Fixed-Length Data Elements
renamed column to reflect contents
need to look more deeply into this column; seems to reference language, country,

Column 245: 
according to MARC 21, Title Statement; $b is subtitle 
renamed column to reflect contents, removed metaexpressions using:
value.replace('^$0$0$a', '')
used custom text facet to find the ones left with ^$0$3$a, have yet to decide what to do about them, separated into two columns for now
According to MARC 21, these numbers show up because "Title begins with a definite or indefinite article that is disregarded in sorting and filing processes. Any diacritical mark, space or mark of punctuation associated with the article and any space or mark of punctuation preceding the first filing character after the article is included in the count of nonfiling characters. Any diacritic, however, associated with the first filing character is not included in the count of nonfiling characters."


Column 260: 
Publication, Distribution; $a - Place of Publication; $b - name of publisher; $c - Date of publication, distribution 
renamed column to reflect contents, removed metaexpressions using:
value.replace('^$ $ $a', '')

Column 35:
System Control Number
renamed column to reflect contents

Column 40:
Cataloging Source; $a - Original cataloging agency; $b - language of cataloging; $e description conventions
renamed column to reflect contents
some were blank because the information was in the wrong column; with a text facet for 40 and a text filter for column 35,
319 matched (exactly the same number that had the info on column 35)
added to 40 with: if(value==null,'$ $ $bLanguage of cataloging varies$ $ $erda based','new')
subtracted from 35: value.replace('$ $ $bLanguage of cataloging varies$ $ $erda based', '')
removed metaexpressions using:
value.replace('^$ $ $a', ' ')
split into three columns for each subfield

Column 310:
Current Publication Frequency; $b - Date of current publication frequency
renamed column to reflect contents, removed metaexpressions using:
value.replace('^$ $ $a', '')
split multi-valued cells by $ $ $b
cluster and edit using different methods and keying functions, also manual clustering by using text facet (when clustering,
we chose to keep information in dutch)
after the manual cluster, we re-joined the multi-valued cells with $ $ $b
Reconciled and matched some of the items in this column, but deleted these changes.

ALL OTHER COLUMNS:
just renamed them to reflect their contents for now
*** I can't find the 900s
Take a look at the 5 items that have info on Column 856 (put a blank facet on it and go to the "False" ones), they might be of interest
